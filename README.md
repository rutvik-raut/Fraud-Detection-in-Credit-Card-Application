# Fraud-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Application

Detection of fraud in Credit Card Application using Hybrid Deep Learning Model. A hybrid model consisting of both Unsupervised (Self Organizing Maps) and Supervised Learning (Artificial Neural Networks) was developed.

Used Self Organizing Maps to initially detect frauds and then feed its result to Artificial Neural Networks, to achieve maximum accuracy. The ultimate result obtained was a ranking of the predicted probabilities that the customer might cheat the bank.
